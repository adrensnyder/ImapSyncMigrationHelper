### [IMAPSYNC]
# The MAIL_LIST file (or any file you specify in the FILE_CREDS var) must contain lines in the following format.
# MAIL_ORIG PASS_ORIG MAIL_DEST PASS_DEST "PARAMS"
#
# Lines starting with # are treated as comments.
# The first 4 fields are mandatory: MAIL_ORIG PASS_ORIG MAIL_DEST PASS_DEST
# The fifth field ("PARAMS") is optional.
# Note: For Office 365 accounts, a real password is not required. Use a fake value in the PASS_* fields instead.
#
# The optional "PARAMS" field in mail_list is applied only to that specific migration row.
# These parameters are added *after* the global PARAM defined in this file â€” they do not replace it.
# This allows you to define global settings and extend them with per-migration options if needed.
#
# If you are using 365, I recommend applying a 150MB limit for both sending and receiving to the account used in the login for the token
# Set-mailbox -Identity $UPN -MaxReceiveSize 150mb -MaxSendSize 150mb

# Solve error in case of missing header during parse
ADDHEADER=1

# Enable dry run
DRY=1

# Allows only creating a list of differences without copying anything
LISTFOLDERS=1

# Allows automapping folders of different languages
#
# NOTE: Manual exceptions can be applied in PARAM
# IMPORTANT: When using these exceptions, always check the logs to ensure that the variations are applied correctly
#
# This does not map subfolders
# --f1f2 'FolderOrig'='FolderDest'
# Example: --f1f2 'Folder1'='Trash' --f1f2 'Folder2'='Sent'
#
# This also maps subfolders with regex, but syntax and conversions should be carefully considered.
# In this example, we convert a folder in the root from Folder1 to Trash and from Folder2 to Sent.
# ^ specifies that the string must start with that character, avoiding renaming strings in the middle.
# Example: --regextrans2 's/^Folder1/Trash/' --regextrans2 's/^Folder2/Sent/'

# Manual parameters applied to all the mailbox
# OFFICE365: They recommend --regexflag 's/\\Flagged//g'. Personally not used
# GMAIL: They recommend --synclabels --resynclabels
# MAXLINE: If unable to copy a message due to the Maximum size error, try --truncmess 150_000_000
# EXCLUSIONS: If copying from 365 i suggest to add these exclusions to PARAM (Check folder's name cause i've traduced from another language)
# --exclude '^Calendar$' --exclude '^Contacts$' --exclude '^Calendar/Holidays$' --exclude '^Calendar/Birthdays$' --exclude '^Activities$' --exclude '^Sync Issues$' -exclude '^Sync Issues/Conflicts$' -exclude '^Sync Issues/Local errors$' -exclude '^Sync Issues/Server errors$' -exclude '^Feed RSS$'
